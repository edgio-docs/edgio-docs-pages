# XDN regions

## Architecture

Moovweb XDN has multiple global regions in which it will automatically provision the following:

* compute resources that run your code in two geographically close but entirely separate data centers (see [high availability](overview#section_high_availability))
* a level 2 cache to maximize the global cache hit rate and reduces traffic to your servers

## Regions

The XDN is available in the following global regions:

* Americas: Eastern US and Western US
* Europe: Ireland, UK, Western Europe, Northern Europe, Central Europe
* Asia: Japan
* Oceania: Australia

Enterprise customers you can choose in which region workloads run. If you have particular needs, other regions can be configured specifically for you.

All free tier workloads run in Eastern US region.
