# Status Codes

[HTTP status codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes) are how the web returns errors from the server to the web browser. If there is an error from your backend website, the error is simply forwarded by the XDN to the browser. If there is generated by the XDN itself Moovweb generates a 53x HTTP status code. If the HTTP status code appears in the table below, then the error came from the Moovweb Cloud. 

| CODE | NAME | DESCRIPTION |
| -- | -- | -- |
| 412 | Precondition Failed | This code is returned when a request contains `x-xdn-prefetch: 1` and the result is not found in the edge cache. |
| 530 | Internal Moovweb Error | Unexpected error in the Moovweb Cloud. Contact Moovweb support. |
| 531 | Upstream Timeout | Timeout connecting to your upstream website or receiving response from your upstream website. Check your originating website for issues. |
| 532 | Bad Request | The received HTTP request is not valid. Check your requesting URL and your project config. |
| 533 | Engine Timeout | The engine timed out executing your project code. Check your project code for performance or blocking issues. |
| 535 | Project Fetch Error | The HTTP header ‘hostname’ is missing or does not match any active Moovweb project. Check your requesting URL and your project config. |
| 536 | Access Denied Error | The upstream address resolved to an IP that is blocked by a proxy (via ip-blacklist config). Check your project for invalid host or IP address. |
| 537 | DNS Resolution Error | The Moovweb servers received a DNS error when attempting to resolve the upstream hostname. Check your project config and your domain’s DNS setup. |
| 538 | Request Loop Error | User exceeded the maximum level (4) of nested Moovweb requests. “Nested” means a Moovweb site is the upstream of another Moovweb site. Exceeding the limit results in a request loop error, indicating the request’s upstream origin site is itself. |
