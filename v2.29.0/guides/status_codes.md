# Status Codes

[HTTP status codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes) are how the web signals errors and other states from the server to the web browser. If there is an error from your backend website, the error is simply forwarded by the XDN to the browser. If the error is generated by the XDN itself Moovweb generates a 53x or 54x HTTP status code. If the HTTP status code appears in the table below, then the error came from the Moovweb Cloud. 

| CODE | NAME | DESCRIPTION |
| -- | -- | -- |
| 412 | Precondition Failed | This code is returned when query string parameter `xdn_prefetch` equals `1` and the result is not found in the edge cache. |
| 530 | Internal Error | Unexpected error in the Moovweb XDN. Please contact [support](https://help.moovweb.com). |
| 531 | Project Upstream Timeout | User's XDN project timed out while waiting for an upstream response. |
| 532 | Project Response Too Large | User's XDN project returned a response size greater than the allowed 6MB. |
| 533 | Obsolete | Not used by Moovweb XDN. |
| 534 | Project Error | The serverless project code has failed unexpectedly. Use [server logs](/guides/logs#section_server_logs) to debug. |
| 535 | Unknown Project | The HTTP header `host` is missing or does not match any Moovweb XDN deployment. Check your requesting URL and your project config. |
| 536 | Obsolete | Not used by Moovweb XDN. |
| 537 | Obsolete | Not used by Moovweb XDN. |
| 538 | Project Request Loop | User exceeded the maximum level (4) of nested Moovweb XDN requests. “Nested” means an XDN site is the upstream of another XDN site. Exceeding the limit results in a request loop error, indicating the request’s upstream origin site is itself. |
| 539 | Project Timeout | The serverless project code did not respond on time, either due to slow upstreams or to badly handled asynchronous requests in the user’s code (e.g. missing `await` or call to `callback`). Use [server logs](/guides/logs#section_server_logs) and [performance profiling](/guides/performance) to debug. |
| 540 | Project Out of Memory | User's CDN project consumed memory greater than the allows 1,792MB |
| 541 | Out of Workers | The traffic was so high that request could not be scheduled for processing within the scheduling timeout. Please contact [support](/guides/support) to upgrade your account. |
| 542 | Project Header Overflow | Either the request or response had too many HTTP headers. See [limits](/guides/limits) |
