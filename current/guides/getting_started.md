# Getting Started

## Install Node.js and npm

__XDN only supports Node.js version 12 and higher__

If you do not have Node.js installed on your system, download and install it from official [Node.js downloads](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) page. Select the download labeled "LTS (Recommended For Most Users)" and that matches your operating system, and run the installer. Note that the installer for Node.js will also install npm.

## Adding the XDN to an existing app

To add the XDN to an existing app, run the following:

```bash
npm i -g @xdn/cli

## Creating a new XDN app

```bash
npm create xdn-app@latest
```

... or using yarn ...

yarn create xdn-app@latest
```
