# Status Codes

[HTTP status codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes) are how the web signals errors and other states from the server to the web browser. If there is an error from your backend website, the error is simply forwarded by the XDN to the browser. If the error is generated by the XDN itself Moovweb generates a 53x or 54x HTTP status code. If the HTTP status code appears in the table below, then the error came from the Moovweb Cloud. 

| CODE | NAME | DESCRIPTION |
| -- | -- | -- |
| 412 | Precondition Failed | This code is returned when query string parameter `xdn_prefetch` equals `1` and the result is not found in the edge cache. |
| 530 | Internal Moovweb Error | Unexpected error in the Moovweb XDN. Please contact [support](https://help.moovweb.com). |
| 531 | Obsolete | Not used by Moovweb XDN. |
| 532 | Obsolete | Not used by Moovweb XDN. |
| 533 | Obsolete | Not used by Moovweb XDN. |
| 534 | Project Error | The serverless project code has failed unexpectedly. Use [server logs](/guides/logs#section_server_logs) to debug. |
| 535 | Project Fetch Error | The HTTP header `host` is missing or does not match any Moovweb XDN deployment. Check your requesting URL and your project config. |
| 536 | Obsolete | Not used by Moovweb XDN. |
| 537 | Obsolete | Not used by Moovweb XDN. |
| 538 | Request Loop Error | User exceeded the maximum level (4) of nested Moovweb XDN requests. “Nested” means an XDN site is the upstream of another XDN site. Exceeding the limit results in a request loop error, indicating the request’s upstream origin site is itself. |
| 539 | Worker Timeout | The serverless project code did not respond on time, either due to slow upstreams or to badly handled asynchronous requests in the user’s code. Use [server logs](/guides/logs#section_server_logs) and [performance profiling](/guides/performance) to debug. |
| 540 | Reserved | Reserved for experimental limits and features. Please contact [support](https://help.moovweb.com). |
| 541 | Out of Workers | The traffic was so high that request could not be scheduled for processing within the scheduling timeout. Please contact [support](/guides/support) to upgrade your account. |
| 542 | Header Overflow | Either the request or response had too many HTTP headers. See [limits](/guides/limits) |
